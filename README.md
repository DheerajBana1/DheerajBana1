# The use of Machine Learning in Structural Health Monitoring
With the developments in data processing power and sensing technologies, it is evident that in the coming years, there would be high uses of machine learning (ML) techniques in the civil engineering field. There have already been some uses of ML in geotechnical and structural engineering across the world. In this project, I too want to work on the applications of ML in Civil Structural Health Monitoring. The failure of any civil engineering costs millions. So, it's very important to monitor these structures, to avoid failure because of poor maintenance. There are some manual ways to monitor the health of structures, but they are not much effective due to the subjectivity and the time and labor involved. So instead we can use the data measured automatically by structural sensors, along with new advanced techniques like ML and data science to monitor the health of the structures. I particularly want to focus on bridges, as they are important structures and play a very critical role in our everyday life. Nowadays, there are frequent failures, while not catastrophic, some parts of the bridge fail and stop working; hence, it's very important to monitor the health of these bridge structures.
